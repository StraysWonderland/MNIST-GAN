## Getting Started
You can view the notebook here on github. 
### Run the notebook
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter

#### starting the notebook
Simply open a new terminal in the directory and type:
```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
#### setup model
make sure you run all codeblocks from top to bottom to setup the network

### Running the tests
To test the model, you need only to run the last codeblock.
This will evaluate the model and print the accuracy for each testset.

## Built With

* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - The framework to create the model
* [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - Nice and easy python notebooks
